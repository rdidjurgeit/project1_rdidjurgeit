        <h1>Learn How to Sail with Rapha Did</h1>
        <p>Like coding Sailing can be relatively easy, you can learn the basics of how to but you will need time to master the technics. Sailing is a mix of specific knowledge, skill and a gut instinct. Also a respect for the weather

            <h2>Beginner Sailing Tips</h2>
            <p>
                Let us help you master the basics with these handy sailing tips and instructions for beginners. You can also read our sailboat buying guide and watch videos on sailing, plus compare sailboat brands to find the right one for you. Both novice and experienced sailors alike can benefit from a quick review of these beginner sailing basics!
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Choose calm, uncrowded waters:</b> If you’re just starting to master sailing basics and learn how to sail, then one of the most important beginner sailing tips to remember is to practice in ideal conditions of light winds and low traffic.</li>
                    <li><b>Choose a small boat:</b> to learn how to sail It’s easier to learn how to sail with fewer lines and sails. A small dinghy will be more responsive and easier to maneuver, and is also perfect for practicing test capsizes in (see tip #7 below).</li>
                    <li><b>Begin on a boat rigged with one sail:</b> Similar to the above, beginning on a boat that’s rigged with just one sail will make learning sailing basics easier and less complicated.</li>
                    <li><b>Follow sailing basics for safety:</b> There are certain sailing basics for safe boating that should go without saying, no matter what your level of expertise. These include always telling someone before you go out on the water, always bringing a floatation device and knowing in advance how to swim. For additional information, please see our <a href="./boatsafe.html">safe boating</a> pages.</li>
                    <li><b>Research tide, wind and weather conditions: </b>Check the weather forecast so you can be prepared for whatever the weather might bring. Be sure to bring along adequate provisions, clothing and basic weather gear as needed. Boating and sailing basics means always being prepared.</li>
                    <li><b>Become familiar with sail control: </b>The best sailors are the ones who are able to adjust sail settings to take the best advantage of different wind and water conditions. In general, sails should be relatively flat when the wind is either very light or very strong, and full when there is a moderate wind.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Capsize on purpose:</b> This may seem like one of the oddest beginner sailing tips we could suggest, but it’s better to practice how to handle a capsized sailboat within a controlled environment, as opposed to an uncontrolled one. We learn best from experience, and the valuable sailing basics you’ll pick up from going through a test-capsize in a small dinghy will serve you well in the event of a real-life one.</li>
                    <li><b>Respect the boom:</b> Some of the most common sailing injuries are a result of not being aware when the boom is about to swing. To avoid a bump to the head, or even worse, being knocked overboard, one of the most important beginner sailing tips to always remember for both passengers and crew is to be conscious and respectful of the boom at all times.</li>
                    <li><b>Learn basic sailing terms:</b> Before you venture out on your first trip, be sure to acquaint yourself with basic sailing terms.Make sure you know the difference between port, starboard, and other important concepts.</li>
                    <li><b>Practice makes perfect:</b> Don’t try to teach yourself all the sailing basics. Invest in a good sailing course, research guides and books, and learn from friends with experience.</li>

                <h3>1. Aft </h3>
                <p>The back of a ship. If something is located aft, it is at the back of the sailboat. The aft is also known as the stern. 
                </p>
                <h3>2. Bow</h3> 
                    <p>The front of the ship is called the bow. Knowing the location of the bow of the boat is important for defining two of the other most common sailing terms: port (left of the bow) and starboard side (right of the bow). 
                    </p>
                <h3>3. Port </h3>
                <p>Port is always the left-hand side of the boat when you are facing the bow. Because “right” and “left” can become confusing sailing terms when used out in the open waters, port defines the left side of the boat as it relates to the bow or front. 
                </p>
                <h3>4. Starboard </h3>
                <p>Starboard is always the right-hand side of the boat when you are facing the bow. Because “right” and “left” can become confusing sailing terms when used out in the open waters, starboard defines the right-hand side of the boat as it relates to the bow or front. 
                </p>
                <h3>5. Leeward </h3>
                <p>Also known as lee, leeward is the opposite direction of the wind blowing (windward). 
                </p>
                <h3>6. Windward </h3>
                <p>The direction in which the wind is currently blowing. Windward is the opposite of leeward (the opposite direction of the wind). Sailboats tend to move with the wind, making the windward direction an important sailing term to know.
                </p>
                <h3>7. Boom </h3>
                <p>The boom is the horizontal pole extending from the mast’s bottom. The sailboat can harness wind power to move forward or backward. This is done by adjusting the boom towards the direction of the wind. 
                </p>
                <h3>8. Rudder </h3>
                <p>Located beneath the boat, the rudder is a flat piece of wood, fiberglass, or metal used to steer the boat. Larger sailboats control the rudder via a wheel, while smaller boats will have a steering mechanism directly aft. 
                </p>
                <h3>9. Tacking </h3>
                <p>The opposite of jibing, this basic sailing maneuver refers to turning the boat’s bow through the wind so that the wind changes from one side of the boat to the other. The boom of a boat will constantly shift from one side to the other when performing a tack or a jibe. 
                </p>
                <h3>10. Jibing </h3>
                <p>The opposite of tacking, this basic sailing maneuver refers to turning the stern of the boat through the wind so that the wind changes from one side of the boat to the other. The boom of a boat will always shift from one side to the other when performing a tack or a jibe. Jibing is a less common technique than tacking since it involves turning a boat directly into the wind.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion: Learn Nautical Terms Before Setting Sail!</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, knowing sailing terms and phrases is an essential skill for anyone who wants to take up sailing as a hobby. It enables sailors to communicate effectively with each other and understand the different parts of the boat and their functions. It also enhances safety and reduces the risk of accidents on the water. 
                Therefore, whether you are a seasoned sailor or a beginner, learning these sailing terms can enhance your enjoyment of this exciting and rewarding sport!

            <h2>Sailing Rules & Instructions<i class="fa fa-life-ring" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
            <p>1. Always maintain a proper lookout by sight as well as hearing to avoid colliding with other boats. 
            </p>
            <p>2. Maintain a safe speed at all times so that you remain in control of your boat.
            </p>
            <p>3. Use common sense when assessing risk of collision with other boats near and around you. 
            </p>
            <p>4. Port tack gives way to starboard tack: If two sailboats are approaching each other and the wind is on a different side of each boat, then sailing rules are that the sailboat which has the wind on the port side must always give right of way to the other. (The port side is the left-hand side of the boat when you are facing the front.) 
            </p>
            <p>5. Windward gives way to leeward: If two sailboats are approaching each other and the wind is on the same side of each boat, then sailing rules are that the vessel which is to windward (the direction of the wind) must give the right of way to the vessel which is leeward (the opposite direction of the wind). 
            </p>
            <p>6. A sailboat should always keep out of the way of any boat that is: a) not under command, b) restricted in its ability to maneuver, and c) engaged in fishing 
            </p>
            <p>7. When passing through a narrow channel, sailing instructions are to keep as close to the outer edge as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>8. Non-commercial powerboats usually give way to sailboats, unless the sailboat is overtaking it. However, general sailing instructions are also that sailboats should try to stay out of the way of large vessels and ferryboats that may find it harder to slow or change direction—especially in narrow channels.
